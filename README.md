**🎉 Incentivize Share – Turning Everyday Sharing into a Scalable Growth Loop at Weee!**

How a simple human behavior became a measurable driver of growth

⚠️ Disclaimer
This project focuses on how we approached growth initiatives, not on proprietary systems or confidential data. The goal is to show how we think, how we analyze customer behavior, and how we translate those insights into a scalable, data-driven strategy. All examples and metrics are modified or anonymized to comply with data security policies.

---------------------------------
Before jumping to any campaigns or proposas
We didn’t start this project by asking, “What feature should we build?”
We started with a much simpler question:

_“What are users already doing, even when we don’t reward them?” 🤔
Behavioral data revealed a clear pattern. A meaningful portion of new users were already coming from shared links — via 💬 text messages, Messenger, group chats. Orders that were discussed socially tended to convert better and had larger baskets. 

_Sharing wasn’t something we needed to invent — it was something we hadn’t yet measured or amplified._

That insight reframed the challenge: growth didn’t need to be pushed. It needed to be designed around natural human behavior 🌱.

**Why we did it???**

At Weee!, we noticed something simple but powerful: people naturally talk about their baskets 🛍️. Friends ask, “Hey, what’s in your cart?” That curiosity is social currency 💎.

We asked: why not make sharing a basket easy, rewarding, and fun 🎮?

1st Users share what they’re buying → friends get points or discounts 🎁

->>> Friends join → users earn rewards 💵

->>> Sellers benefit → everyone wins 🌟

_**A triple win, and the heart of the Incentivize Share initiative was born.**_

**How we designed it: human behavior + data 📈**

**1. Turning Users into Advocates (Affiliate Program) 💪**

Our first insight: some users were naturally sharing links more than others. These super-users drove disproportionate value, with higher order frequency, larger baskets, and greater downstream GMV 💸.

Mechanic: Users sign up as affiliates, share personalized links, and both they and their friends receive $20 💵 when the friend registers. Users also earn 2–6% commission 💰 on subsequent purchases for six months. This isn’t a new idea,  affiliate programs have existed forever  but the data shows it always works as a growth engine when executed thoughtfully


- Tracked new sign-ups 🆕 and orders within 48 hours ⏱ to ensure referral quality

- Provided dashboards 📊 to visualize performance and ROI

- Optimized messaging to highlight high-value sharing opportunities, not just raw volume

Result: 60+ active affiliates felt empowered to advocate for products they loved 💖. Collectively, they brought in ~1,000 new users monthly

**Second, Making Sharing Personal (Invite Friends) 🤝**

<img width="754" height="611" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c1cfed2-0df7-40cc-9865-4d7a420afb9b" />

Most users didn’t want to be affiliates — they just wanted to help friends or share something useful. We noticed that this natural behavior could become a scalable growth channel if we made it easy and rewarding.
Data showed that peer-to-peer invites converted far better than generic campaigns ✅, and invited users were more likely to complete second orders 🔄.

Mechanic: One-click in-app share via link 🔗 or QR code 📱. Friends receive $10 💵 after their first order, $10 💵 after the second, plus 2–6% commission 💰 on future purchases.

Execution & Data Insights:

- Increased sharing frequency and engagement

- Tracked referrals with lifecycle dashboards 📊 to identify high-value advocates then later turn them into power users.

- Measured new user acquisition 🆕 and first/second order completion rates to ensure quality

Outcome: The program quickly became a repeatable, steady source of high-quality users 🌱, not just one-off signups. Monthly, peer-to-peer invites contributed ~500 new users with high second-order activation.


**Last driven and most powerful program, Gamifying the Basket (Weeebates) 🎲**

<img width="710" height="645" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94f4a6ec-79c2-4f82-87ee-8f2b64295585" />

Finally, we examined the basket itself. Sharing shouldn’t be static — it should be playful and rewarding 🥳.

Mechanic: Post-purchase, users select items to share. Friends click “chop chop” ✂️ links to help, earning points 🎯 that convert into discounts for the sharer. The points are randomized, creating a mini-lottery game 🎰.

Data-driven execution:

Measured shares per order 🔄, clicks 🖱️, and follow-buy conversion 💹

Optimized item selection, timing ⏰, and reward allocation for maximum engagement

Observed community growth 🌐, including 40k+ members in Facebook groups 👥

Outcome: Sharing became habitual. Users actively shared baskets, friends joined, sellers gained incremental sales 💵, and the community became more engaged and sticky 🏆.

The Growth Flywheel 🔁

By designing three complementary sharing mechanisms, we created a self-reinforcing growth loop:

More shares 🗣️ → More users 🆕 → More orders 🛒 → More engagement 💬 → Repeat 🔄

Incentives alone weren’t enough. By designing natural, social, and rewarding experiences 🎯, users shared because it was fun and valuable — not because we told them to.


**Key Takeaways ✨**

📊 Growth starts with observing human behavior 👀, not building features first

🔄 Incentives are effective only when tied to measurable, high-quality actions 

💹 Gamification can turn mundane actions (sharing a basket) into repeatable, scalable engagement 

Data is essential at every step — from identifying advocates to validating follow-buy conversions

When sharing feels natural, fun 🎉, and rewarding 🏆, users help each other — and growth happens organically.
